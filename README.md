# Marketing-SQL-Project

The goal of this project is to uncover customer behavior and purchasing activity to inform and optimize marketing strategy. Using recency, total revenue and demographic data I segmented customers to identify retention, upsell and cross sell opportunities. I also analyzed campaign response rates and product preferences to determine which segments drive the most revenue and how they can be targeted more effectively.
Below are the key insights and recommendations found from my analysis.

## Customer Segments
1. Adults (35–64) and young adults (25–34) represent the largest customer groups with a median purchase recency of 46–50 days. This suggests an optimal retention window of 45–55 days.
2. Young adults in committed relationships without kids show a shorter purchase cycle (38 days) with a sufficient sample size making them strong candidates for early touch retention and upsell campaigns within this age segment.


## Marital Status, Income & Household Insights
1. High income customers ($150k+) without kids spend the most per person. They are ideal for upsell and premium campaigns.
2. Middle income customers ($61k–$100k) also spend well especially those who are single or married without kids. Target them for retention and upsell efforts.
3.Lower income customers ($30k–$60k and below) or those with kids spend the least. They are best suited for awareness campaigns, cross sell promotions or discounts to encourage engagement.


## Product Insights (Monetary Analysis)
1. Wines drive the highest average spend ($303/customer) followed by Meats and Gold.
2. Fish, Fruits and Sweets have the lowest spend indicating cross sell potential. Loyalty programs and promotions should focus on high value products while bundling or discounts can boost low spend categories.



## Campaign Performance
1. Campaigns 3–5 perform best with response rates above 7%. Campaign 2 performs poorly (1.34%) and requires re testing.
2. Customers with kids respond strongly to Campaign 3 suggesting family targeted promotions.



## Upsell & Cross-Sell Opportunities
1. Upsell: Meat, Wines, and Gold show the highest upsell potential with 46–50% of customers in these categories spending below the median. Targeting these customers could increase revenue per buyer.
2. Cross sell:  Sweets, Fruits and Fish have the most non buyers 17–19% representing opportunities for targeted promotions.


## Recommendations
1. Run retention campaigns targeting adults and young adults around the 45–55 day purchase window.
2. Launch upsell campaigns for below median spenders in high value categories. (Meat, Wines, Gold).
3. Introduce cross sell campaigns for non buyers in low spend categories in Sweets, Fruits and Fish using tailored promotions.
4. Focus on improving low performing campaigns like Campaign 2 through A/B testing or trying to test new messages.
5. Focus premium campaigns on high income customers, retention campaigns on middle income customers with strong spend and awareness, cross sell or discount campaigns for lower income customers or those with kids.
